For my twitch project, my non-human character would be called "Jaimleen". My character will be half human and half horse. The setting would be in a desert-like area.  I will also add more character that look just like him. The object of the game would be him trying to save his daughter. They will be fighting,cooking, etc. Things to be able to survive so that they would be able to get to their final destination.
