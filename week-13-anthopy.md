1) Do you think that violent games can affect you in the real world?

2)Do you believe if the coding and video game industry was more diverse , there would be different types of games or would they be the same?

3)Do you agree that games are not to be fun, but rather an experience?

1) I believe that playing violent games does affect a person psychologically. There have been many studies that show this to be true. Especially, if you start playing violent games at a really young age you can see the affect it has on children. They become more violent and become easily influenced of whats going on around them. 

I am a preschool and kindergarten teacher. There have been many instances where children are imitating a gun. This is because they see it all the time. Whether it is TV or video games,they become greatly influenced. They begin to copy everything that a person is doing. Children are like sponges and everything they see they want to copy.

This could also affect kids when they are older. They are use to seeing violence so they act upon it. If they are not exposed to it as early than i believe there would be a different response.
