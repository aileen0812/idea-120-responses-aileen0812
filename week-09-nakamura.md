Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone else's "mental structure" is to be understood in the sense that people are the ones going on the app and figuring out how things are going to be.The people who are making the app have to put into perspective how things are going to work for others.For example when someone get on Tiktok , they wll have a FOR YOU PAGE, this page will have most of their interests with things that they have liked. This will accustom to their likings which will have a user returning because it is not broad but a narrow idea. Then they have a other part where they have their following which will only be content from pepople that they have followed.
