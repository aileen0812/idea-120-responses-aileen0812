In the reading that "Something is wrong on the Internet", the uthor James Bridles talks about how the internet has a great influence on what our identity is like. He doesn't think that it is a great idea that children are on websites like youtube. In the reading he talks about how strange kids videos are. He talks about how adults believe that many are harmless if they are "kid friendly" such as nursery rhymes and such. However, there are many red flags and many creepy signs throughout the videos
I agree with Bridle 100%. I am a teacher for kindergarten and preschool children. I put a lot of kids videos for them, when i feel like they are educational. Yet, I remember one time i decided that i wanted to put cocomelon on for them. I would start listening to the songs and i started to realize how actually weird they were. There was this part of the video where the father was scolding the wife as if she was in trouble. Which i found to be sexist and very strange.
